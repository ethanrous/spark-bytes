## Sprint 7 Progress and Test Plan

Users can now log in, sign up, view, and create events. For testing, we will conduct unit testing for each of our modules and integration testing will be conducted by running through our primary user stories in various scenarios. As a catchup for next sprint, we will also implement the email notifications for users signed up for an event.

## Running the Application
To test, simply run 
```bash
./scripts/run
```
This script will start the database, compile the frontend, and start the backend. You can then navigate to `localhost:5001` to view the application. ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) must be installed)
Note: It may prompt for sudo password to start the database.
